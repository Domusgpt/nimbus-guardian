## ü§ñ AI-Powered Intelligence

### Automatic Context Detection

Guardian's AI understands:
- Your experience level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Your tech stack
- Your cloud providers
- Your framework
- Your deployment targets

### Smart Recommendations

```bash
guardian scan --ai
```

AI analyzes your issues and:
1. Explains each issue in terms you understand
2. Prioritizes what to fix first
3. Suggests the fastest path to deployment
4. Teaches you as you go

### Example AI Analysis:

**For Beginners:**
```
ü§ñ AI Explanation:

You have a .env file tracked in git. Here's why this is critical:

What it means: Your secret keys (like database passwords and API keys)
are being saved in your git history. Anyone who can see your repository
can see these secrets.

Why it's dangerous: If someone gets your database password, they could
delete all your data or steal user information.

How to fix:
1. Run: git rm --cached .env
2. Make sure .env is in .gitignore
3. Change all the passwords/keys that were exposed

How to prevent: Always add .env to .gitignore BEFORE your first commit!
```

**For Advanced Users:**
```
ü§ñ Security Analysis:

Critical: Credentials exposed in git history (commit: a1b2c3d)

Impact: Complete compromise of production infrastructure
- Database: full read/write access
- API keys: unlimited quota consumption
- AWS credentials: potential account takeover

Remediation:
1. Rotate all exposed credentials immediately
2. Audit CloudTrail/logs for unauthorized access
3. Implement AWS Secrets Manager for credential management
4. Add pre-commit hooks (git-secrets) to prevent recurrence
5. Consider git history rewrite (BFG Repo-Cleaner) if recently committed

Priority: Stop all deployments until credentials rotated.
```
