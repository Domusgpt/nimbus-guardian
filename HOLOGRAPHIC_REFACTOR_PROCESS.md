# Holographic Dashboard Refactor Process Log

This log tracks the staged refactor of the holographic dashboard frontend. Each entry captures the intent for a working session, the major changes that landed, and any follow-up items that rolled forward.

## Guiding Objectives
- Keep the cinematic UI experience intact while making the codebase maintainable and testable.
- Consolidate shared behaviors into importable modules so future dashboards can reuse them.
- Add automated coverage for networking, assistant, and UI edge cases as the code becomes more modular.
- Document API expectations and architectural decisions alongside the code so backend teams can integrate with confidence.

## Session Timeline
### Session 1 — API contracts documentation (Completed)
- Authored `DASHBOARD_API_CONTRACTS.md` detailing the response shapes, cache semantics, and error expectations for each card.
- Outcome: Backend implementers now have a canonical contract reference, unblocking server work.

### Session 2 — Script modularization (Completed)
- Extracted the monolithic inline `<script>` into dedicated motion, networking, and assistant modules.
- Wired a module-based orchestrator from the HTML shell to preserve behavior without inline handlers.
- Outcome: Frontend logic is now split by concern, making targeted changes and testing feasible.

### Session 3 — Shared loaders and tests (Completed)
- Introduced shared card fallback helpers so status, tools, deployments, and GitHub loaders react to offline/cache states consistently.
- Added Vitest with jsdom plus unit coverage for assistant actions and networking behaviors, exposing an `npm test` workflow.
- Outcome: Core loaders share a single source of truth for fallback UX, and new regressions surface through automated tests.

### Session 4 — UI utilities & process hygiene (Completed)
- Extracted toast, loading overlay, badge, and timestamp meta helpers into `public/js/holographic/ui.js`, rewiring the orchestrator to import them instead of redefining inline utilities.
- Stubbed noisy console errors inside Vitest assistant specs to keep the test run output readable.
- Established this process log so each follow-up session captures goals, shipped changes, and rolled-over ideas.

## Upcoming Focus Candidates
- Explore lazy-loading assistant assets so core status cards paint faster on slow devices.
- Extract clipboard, timestamp formatting, and toast helpers into packages consumable by other admin tools.
- Extend Vitest coverage to card rendering helpers and motion behaviors, including offline timelines.
- Evaluate bundling strategy (Vite/ESBuild) for production readiness once module boundaries stabilize.
