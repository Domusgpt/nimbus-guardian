# Holographic Dashboard Refactor Process Log

This log tracks the staged refactor of the holographic dashboard frontend. Each entry captures the intent for a working session, the major changes that landed, and any follow-up items that rolled forward.

## Guiding Objectives
- Keep the cinematic UI experience intact while making the codebase maintainable and testable.
- Consolidate shared behaviors into importable modules so future dashboards can reuse them.
- Add automated coverage for networking, assistant, and UI edge cases as the code becomes more modular.
- Document API expectations and architectural decisions alongside the code so backend teams can integrate with confidence.

## Session Timeline
### Session 1 — API contracts documentation (Completed)
- Authored `DASHBOARD_API_CONTRACTS.md` detailing the response shapes, cache semantics, and error expectations for each card.
- Outcome: Backend implementers now have a canonical contract reference, unblocking server work.

### Session 2 — Script modularization (Completed)
- Extracted the monolithic inline `<script>` into dedicated motion, networking, and assistant modules.
- Wired a module-based orchestrator from the HTML shell to preserve behavior without inline handlers.
- Outcome: Frontend logic is now split by concern, making targeted changes and testing feasible.

### Session 3 — Shared loaders and tests (Completed)
- Introduced shared card fallback helpers so status, tools, deployments, and GitHub loaders react to offline/cache states consistently.
- Added Vitest with jsdom plus unit coverage for assistant actions and networking behaviors, exposing an `npm test` workflow.
- Outcome: Core loaders share a single source of truth for fallback UX, and new regressions surface through automated tests.

### Session 4 — UI utilities & process hygiene (Completed)
- Extracted toast, loading overlay, badge, and timestamp meta helpers into `public/js/holographic/ui.js`, rewiring the orchestrator to import them instead of redefining inline utilities.
- Stubbed noisy console errors inside Vitest assistant specs to keep the test run output readable.
- Established this process log so each follow-up session captures goals, shipped changes, and rolled-over ideas.

### Session 5 — Assistant lazy-loading & loader utilities (Completed)
- Introduced `public/js/holographic/assistant-loader.js` to dynamically import assistant logic, cache the actions, and expose preload/invocation helpers.
- Updated `dashboard-main.js` to lazily load assistant features, wrap auto-fix/install handlers with error toasts, and idle-preload the module after initial paint.
- Added Vitest coverage around the assistant loader to ensure caching, error surfacing, and idle preloads behave as expected.

### Session 6 — Deferred heavy card refreshes (Completed)
- Extracted a dedicated `createRefreshScheduler` utility to coordinate interval timers, idle deferrals, and visibility-aware execution for dashboard refresh cycles.
- Updated `dashboard-main.js` to defer GitHub and deployment refreshes until the main thread is idle, reducing contention with the initial status scan.
- Added Vitest coverage for the scheduler to prove idle fallback timing, document visibility guards, and cancellation behaviors work as intended.

### Session 7 — Shared utilities & UI coverage (Completed)
- Promoted toast notifications and timestamp parsing/formatting into `public/js/shared` modules so future dashboards can consume them without duplicating holographic-specific code.
- Rewired the networking layer to depend on the shared time helpers, keeping exports stable while enabling reuse.
- Added Vitest coverage for the shared time utilities and UI helpers to document the DOM behaviors and prevent regressions.

### Session 8 — Clipboard helpers & manual fallbacks (Completed)
- Added a shared `copyText` helper with async Clipboard API and execCommand fallbacks, enabling dashboards to copy commands in any browser environment.
- Updated the tooling card to surface a "Copy" control alongside automated installs so operators can grab shell commands when offline or when assistant actions fail.
- Landed Vitest coverage for the clipboard helper to document behavior and keep regression noise out of future refactors.

### Session 9 — Motion scene testability & fallback coverage (Completed)
- Expanded `initMotionScene` to support injected documents/matchMedia, configurable particle counts, and full teardown of listeners and generated elements during disposal.
- Added Vitest specs for motion preference changes, hover pausing, and cleanup paths to ensure parallax updates stay responsive without leaking resources.
- Covered the card state helpers with unit tests so offline/cache messaging and badge/meta wiring remain consistent as cards evolve.

### Session 10 — Card utility extraction & sharing playbook (Completed)
- Moved tool-label formatting, install/docs resolution, timeline helpers, and security severity heuristics into dedicated `cards` utility modules for reuse across dashboards.
- Added Vitest suites for the new card utilities so formatting, DOM generation, and severity scoring stay stable as cards evolve.
- Authored `SHARED_DASHBOARD_UTILITIES.md` to document how other teams can adopt the shared clipboard/time/UI helpers alongside the new card utilities.

### Session 11 — Bundle metrics and analysis tooling (Completed)
- Added an `analyze:holographic` npm script that runs an esbuild-powered bundle report for `dashboard-main.js`, capturing build time, output sizes, and the heaviest modules.
- Generated the initial bundle snapshot (97.26 kB total output / 18.16 kB gzip) to benchmark the current modular architecture and recorded the top contributors for future optimization passes.
- Logged the report location options so future sessions can write JSON metrics for regression tracking.

## Upcoming Focus Candidates
- Compare minified and non-minified bundle outputs to decide on compression/bundling defaults for production deployments.
- Monitor deferred refresh timings across devices and tune idle timeouts or progressive loading for remaining cards.
- Explore sharing the new clipboard helper across dashboards and CLIs, including documentation snippets that reference the shared module.
- Evaluate bundling strategies (Vite vs. esbuild CLI) once the bundle baseline stabilizes and identify opportunities for code splitting.
