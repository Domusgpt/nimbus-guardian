- ✅ Checks if CLI is installed
- ✅ Provides install instructions
- ✅ Links to documentation

### 2. Framework-Aware Testing Recommendations

Detects your framework and suggests the right testing setup:

| Framework | Unit Tests | E2E Tests | Component Tests |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Next.js | Jest | Playwright | React Testing Library |
| React | Jest | Cypress | React Testing Library |
| Vue | Vitest | Playwright | @vue/test-utils |
| Express | Jest | Supertest | N/A |
| Angular | Karma/Jasmine | Protractor | N/A |

### 3. AI-Powered Explanations

**Three experience levels:**
- 🌱 **Beginner** - Simple, jargon-free explanations
- 🌿 **Intermediate** - Best practices and practical guidance
- 🌳 **Advanced** - Architecture insights and enterprise considerations

**AI adapts to your level** and teaches as you learn!

### 4. Web Dashboard (Port 3333)

Real-time interface showing:
- **Project health** - Dependencies, git status, environment
- **Security scan** - Live issues with severity indicators
- **Git integration** - Branches, commits, uncommitted changes
- **Tool status** - What's installed, what's missing
- **Issues & fixes** - One-click fixes for many problems
- **AI chat** - Built-in assistant right in the UI

### 5. Comprehensive Security Scanning

Detects:
- 🔴 **Critical:** Exposed API keys, secrets in git, hardcoded passwords
- 🟠 **High:** Missing security headers, vulnerable dependencies, Docker root user
- 🟡 **Medium:** No .env.example, missing compression, outdated deps
- ⚪ **Warnings:** No CI/CD, missing monitoring, performance optimizations

**Many issues are auto-fixable!**

### 6. Infrastructure Integration

**GitHub** (via `gh` CLI):
- Repo information
- Issues and PRs
- Actions status
- Direct links

**Firebase** (via `firebase` CLI):
- Project list
- Function status
- Deployment history
- Hosting sites

**Cloud Providers:**
