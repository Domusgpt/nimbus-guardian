## Common First-Time Questions

**Q: Will Guardian change my code?**
A: Only if you say "yes" when it asks! It never makes changes without asking first.

**Q: Do I need API keys to use Guardian?**
A: The scanning works without them! But AI explanations and chat need keys.

**Q: Is this safe? Will my code be sent somewhere?**
A: Scans run 100% locally. Code is only sent to AI when you use `--ai` flag or `chat` command.

**Q: What if I break something?**
A: Guardian uses git, so you can always undo changes with `git reset --hard HEAD`

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: The tool is free! AI services have free tiers (Claude: $5 credit, Gemini: 60 req/min)

**Q: I'm completely new. Will I understand this?**
A: Yes! Guardian explains everything in plain English. Try `guardian learn` to start.

**Q: What should I do first?**
A: Run `guardian setup`, then `guardian learn`, then `guardian scan` on your project.
