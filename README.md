## 🛡️ What Guardian Catches

### Security Issues (CRITICAL)
- ❌ API keys in code
- ❌ .env files in git
- ❌ Missing .gitignore patterns
- ❌ Hardcoded passwords
- ❌ Security vulnerabilities
- ❌ Exposed secrets

### Configuration Problems (HIGH)
- ⚠️ Missing environment files
- ⚠️ No .env.example
- ⚠️ Docker security issues
- ⚠️ Missing security headers
- ⚠️ No error handling

### Best Practices (MEDIUM)
- 💡 Missing compression
- 💡 No caching strategy
- 💡 Outdated dependencies
- 💡 No CI/CD setup
- 💡 Performance optimizations

---

## 🎯 Real-World Example

```bash
$ guardian scan --ai

🔍 Starting comprehensive analysis...

📊 Scan Results
🔴 Critical: 1
🟠 High: 2
🟡 Medium: 3

❌ Issues Found:

🔴 .env file is tracked in git (exposes secrets!)
   📄 .env
   ✅ Auto-fixable

   🤖 AI Explanation:
   When you commit .env to git, anyone with access to your repository
   can see your secret keys and passwords. This is extremely dangerous
   because attackers could use these to access your databases, APIs,
   and user data. Always keep .env in .gitignore!

🟠 Missing security headers (helmet)
   ✅ Auto-fixable

   🤖 AI Explanation:
   Security headers protect your app from common attacks like XSS
   and clickjacking. Helmet is a package that sets these automatically...

$ guardian fix

🔧 Found 2 fixable issues
? Fix these issues? Yes

✅ Removed .env from git
✅ Added helmet to package.json

All fixes applied!
```

## 🌱 For Complete Beginners

Don't worry if terms like "environment variables" or "API keys" sound confusing. Guardian explains everything in plain English!

**First time?** Just run:

```bash
guardian setup
guardian learn
```

Choose "Git & Version Control Basics" and start learning by doing.

**Stuck?** Ask for help:

```bash
guardian chat
```

Type your question in normal English. No technical jargon required!

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Scans** your project files for common issues
2. **Analyzes** with pattern matching and best practice rules
3. **Explains** using AI (Claude or Gemini) at your experience level
4. **Fixes** automatically when safe
5. **Teaches** you how to prevent issues next time

**Privacy:** Your code is only sent to AI when you explicitly use `--ai` flag or `chat` command. Regular scans run 100% locally.
