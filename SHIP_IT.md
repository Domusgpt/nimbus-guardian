### Reddit r/webdev:
```
Title: I built an AI-powered deployment safety checker (catches secrets, security holes, Docker issues)

I kept deploying code with exposed API keys and misconfigured Docker containers. So I built Nimbus Guardian - it scans your project before deployment and catches the stuff you'd regret pushing to production.

**What it does:**
- Scans for exposed secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Validates Docker security (no root user, proper base images)
- Checks Firebase security rules
- Finds dependency vulnerabilities
- AI explanations in plain English (Claude + Gemini)
- Auto-fixes common issues
- 15-second scans

**Why it's different:**
- Actually explains WHY something is wrong, not just WHAT
- Adapts to your skill level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- Works 100% locally (your code never leaves your machine)
- Free and open source

**Install:**
```bash
npm install -g nimbus-guardian
nimbus setup
nimbus scan
```
