---

## ❌ NOT WORKING (Future Work)

### Missing Features (Website Claims These)
- ❌ **NPM Package** - Not published yet
  - Website says: `npm install -g nimbus-guardian`
  - Reality: Must clone repo and `npm link`
  - **Action Needed**: `npm publish --access public`
  - **Priority**: HIGH

- ❌ **AWS Validator** - Platform-specific checks
  - Website claims: "Supports AWS"
  - Reality: Only detects AWS (no deep validation)
  - **Action Needed**: Create validators/aws-validator.js
  - **Priority**: MEDIUM

- ❌ **GCP Validator** - Platform-specific checks
  - Website claims: "Supports GCP"
  - Reality: Only detects GCP (no deep validation)
  - **Action Needed**: Create validators/gcp-validator.js
  - **Priority**: MEDIUM

- ❌ **Azure Validator** - Platform-specific checks
  - Website claims: "Supports Azure"
  - Reality: Only detects Azure (no deep validation)
  - **Action Needed**: Create validators/azure-validator.js
  - **Priority**: LOW

- ❌ **Pre-commit Hook Installer**
  - Website shows: Examples of pre-commit hooks
  - Reality: No `nimbus install-hooks` command
  - **Action Needed**: Add hook installer command
  - **Priority**: MEDIUM

### Documentation (Missing)
- ❌ **Documentation Site** - Comprehensive docs
  - Website links to: Documentation pages
  - Reality: Links go nowhere
  - **Action Needed**: Create docs site (Docusaurus?)
  - **Priority**: HIGH

- ❌ **API Reference** - For programmatic use
  - Website mentions: API Reference
  - Reality: No API docs
  - **Action Needed**: Document GuardianEngine API
  - **Priority**: LOW

### Team/Business Features (Intentionally Not Built)
- ❌ **Pricing Plans** - No payment system
  - Website shows: $0 / $20 / $50 pricing tiers
  - Reality: Everything is free, no payment system
  - **Decision**: Keep free for now, add if demand exists
  - **Priority**: FUTURE (maybe never)

- ❌ **User Authentication** - No login
  - Website mentions: "Public repos only" in free tier
  - Reality: No authentication at all
  - **Decision**: Stay privacy-focused, no tracking
  - **Priority**: FUTURE (if monetizing)

- ❌ **Team Features** - No multi-user
  - Website shows: Team plan with shared dashboard
  - Reality: Single-user only
  - **Decision**: Add if users request it
  - **Priority**: FUTURE

- ❌ **Usage Tracking** - No analytics
  - Website mentions: "10 AI questions/month" limit
  - Reality: No limits, no tracking
  - **Decision**: Privacy-first approach
  - **Priority**: FUTURE (if monetizing)

## 🔍 KNOWN ISSUES

### Critical (Fix Before Launch)
1. **NPM not published** - Can't install as advertised
2. **Dashboard frontend shows demo data** - Not connected to backend
3. **Validators untested** - Docker/Firebase code exists but not tested

### High (Fix Soon)
1. **No docs site** - Links go nowhere
2. **Missing pre-commit hooks** - Promised but not implemented
3. **AWS/GCP validators missing** - Website claims support

### Medium (Can Wait)
1. **No CI/CD examples** - Should have GitHub Actions template
2. **Limited performance analysis** - Only basic checks
3. **No bundle analysis** - Just package detection

### Low (Future)
1. **No API docs** - For programmatic use
2. **No video tutorials** - Would help onboarding
